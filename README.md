Anomaly-detection-on-Stock-Market-using-Autoencoders
This project involves developing an anomaly detection system for stock market data using Autoencoders in TensorFlow. The implementation is presented as a Jupyter Notebook.

Project Overview:
The core idea is to leverage Autoencoders, a type of neural network, to learn the "normal" patterns and behavior within stock market data. Once trained, the autoencoder can then be used to reconstruct new, unseen stock data. Anomalies are identified when the reconstruction error (the difference between the input data and its reconstruction) is significantly high, indicating a deviation from the learned normal patterns.

Key Steps:
Data Preprocessing: This stage involves preparing the raw stock market data for use with the autoencoder. This typically includes tasks such as:

Handling missing values.

Normalization or standardization of features to ensure consistent scaling.

Structuring the data into sequences suitable for time-series analysis if applicable.

Building the Deep Learning Model (Autoencoder):

An autoencoder architecture will be designed using TensorFlow. This typically consists of an encoder part that compresses the input data into a lower-dimensional latent space, and a decoder part that reconstructs the data from this latent representation.

The model will be configured with appropriate layers (e.g., Dense, LSTM, or GRU depending on the data structure), activation functions, and an optimizer.

Training:

The autoencoder will be trained on a dataset of "normal" stock market behavior. The goal during training is to minimize the reconstruction error, allowing the model to effectively learn the underlying patterns of non-anomalous data.

Testing and Anomaly Detection:

After training, the model will be used to reconstruct new stock market data.

The reconstruction error for each data point will be calculated.

A threshold will be set on the reconstruction error; any data point with an error exceeding this threshold will be flagged as an anomaly.

Visualization:
The project includes a plot to visually compare the input stock market data with its reconstructed version by the autoencoder. This visualization helps in understanding how well the model is learning the data and provides a clear indication of where anomalies might be occurring.
